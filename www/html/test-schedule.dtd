XML DTD for the encoding service test schedule. Uses the following doctype:

<!DOCTYPE test-schedule PUBLIC "-//CLOUDHARMONY//DTD ENCODE SERVICE TEST SCHEDULE//EN"

-->

<!--
The "test-schedule" element is the root element used to define one or more test
sets
-->
<!ELEMENT test-schedule (test-set+)>

<!--
The "test-set" element defines the frequency and optional start time offset for
a single set of tests to be performed

  key            the unique identifier for this test set

  frequency      how frequently the tests should be performed

  order          the order in which the tests should be performed - either
                 random or sequential

  providers      either 'all' or a comma separated list of the ids of the 
                 providers in the zc_provider table that should be included
                 in this testing
  
  start-offset   the start time offset for testing. this is the amount of time
                 to wait before starting testing for a given frequency interval
                 based on when the start time was for the previous interval. 
                 For example, if the frequency is daily, and the start-offset 
                 is 60, and testing started a 1:00AM the previous day, then 
                 testing will start at 2:00AM for the day following
